# Development plan

## Product and working structure

Maintain one central collection in `data/` and one app in
`web/attestation-explorer/`. Data collection updates the existing registers and
`data/attestations.json`; the HTML/JS/CSS remain independent of the dataset.
Do not create book-specific charts, numbered dataset revisions, milestone reports,
or permanent replay databases. Use ignored `data/.cache/` for temporary work.
Source attribution belongs with the data; software history belongs in Git.

The project collects explicit scholarly reports of Greek NT manuscript contents
and dates. It does not perform manuscript scholarship. Follow [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
and the [source contract](NTVMR_SOURCE_REPORT_CONTRACT.md). Unknown, contested,
reported-absent, uncollected, and filtered states must stay distinct. Preserve
complete date alternatives and count any reported portion once per witness.

## Current implementation

The current register combines P46, P51, P135, GA 01, and GA 02 across Romans,
1–2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians,
and Hebrews. Default data contains 2,020 graphable coordinates, 5,617 present
witness/verse pairs, 4,483 unknown pairs, and no absent or contested pairs.
Supplementary Romans 16:24 remains in the underlying reference scope.

Galatians has a completed independent indexed search within IDs 10000–19999;
the other books and catalogue ranges do not gain discovery completion merely
through document reuse. Multiple bounded scopes can coexist in the central
discovery register. All rankings describe collected witnesses only.

The data builder validates raw hashes, provenance, mappings, identity, complete
date intervals, and derived results in a fresh temporary SQLite database. Builds
are offline and replace one current JSON file. The app requests that file on load.
The request collector retains budget/resume checkpoints in ignored cache storage.
Older review-table code remains a compatibility implementation, outside the app's
scholarly-report path; its judgments are never admitted as scholarly assertions.

## Next development work

1. Broaden bounded independent witness discovery. Declare a book/range and request
   budget; reuse each document's metadata and contents; update the central register.
   Do not constrain discovery to the witnesses already collected for nearby verses.
2. Establish provider access expectations before bulk collection. Preserve blocked
   states, honor limits, and use canonical HTTPS. Current relay captures retain
   their explicit qualification that upstream TLS verification was not established.
3. Extend supported mappings and source-reported date applicability only when
   required by collected data. Keep ambiguous mappings and claims visible; do not
   infer them from manuscript examination.
4. Keep collection efficient and the app usable as the dataset grows. Measure
   witnesses, usable reports, graphable coordinates, unresolved records, request
   cost, and browser data size. Prefer concrete bottlenecks over new infrastructure.

## Acceptance

- New collection appears in the existing app after refreshing its data file.
- Existing books, witnesses, citations, qualifications, and date alternatives
  survive additions without duplicate witness counts or inferred adjacent coverage.
- Every active claim is attributable to a scholarly source. Explicit disagreement
  is retained and deferred; missing information remains unknown.
- Discovery completeness is scoped independently of coverage and rankability.
- Offline source, normalization, data-loading, and chart tests pass. No manuscript
  examination, local server launch, or live request is part of routine verification.
